            Thank you for starting an application to the CleanBC Industrial
            Incentive Program.
          </h4>
          <p>
            You have <a href="${applicationURL}">started an application</a> on
            behalf of <strong>${operatorName}</strong> for the
            <strong>${facilityName}</strong> facility.
          </p>
          <p>Further steps are necessary to complete a CIIP application:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Fill in each section of the
              <a href="${applicationURL}">application form</a> and fix any
              errors that may be highlighted.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once the application has been filled, you will be prompted to
              request signoff from a Certifying Official at your Reporting
              Operation. Please ensure that person reviews and certifies the
              information provided in your application.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  You will be notified via email when that step is complete.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Once you have received notification that the application has been
              certified, you will need to log in to the CIIP Portal to submit
              the application.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once submitted, you will be notified via email when your
              application has been approved or if any further information is
              required to process your application.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
