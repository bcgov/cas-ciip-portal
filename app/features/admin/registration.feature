Feature: Registration

  As system admin
  I want to be able to be onboarded using my IDIR
  So that I can administer the CIIP application system

  Scenario: request membership in the system admin whitelist
  Scenario: invalid session redirects to login page
  Scenario: import user data from valid session after login
  Scenario: re-import user data from valid session after login when session attributes have changed
  Scenario: registration page allows the user to edit their details within the portal
