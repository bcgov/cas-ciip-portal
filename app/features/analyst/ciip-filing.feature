Feature: CIIP Filing

  As an incentive analyst
  I want to triage the received CIIP filings list
  So that I can analyze filed CIIP applications

  Scenario: view dashboard of all received CIIP filings
  Scenario: filter dashboard of all received CIIP filings by year
  Scenario: filter dashboard of all received CIIP filings by status
  Scenario: view details of a received CIIP filing
  Scenario: view diff between received CIIP filing data and SWRS imported data
  Scenario: flag specific portions of the received CIIP filing for industry review with a description of the potential error
  Scenario: approve a received CIIP filing
  Scenario: reject a received CIIP filing
  Scenario: view log of all flags made by incentive analysts alonside all industry corrections
  Scenario: carbon tax calculation based exclusively on data in each CIIP filing and not data in SWRS
