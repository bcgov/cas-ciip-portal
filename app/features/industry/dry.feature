Feature: DRY (don't repeat yourself)

  As an industry reporter
  I want data I have already reported be re-used wherever possible
  So that I do not have to repeat myself

  Scenario: industry reporter is prompted to import data from a specific SWRS Emissions report (by date)
  Scenario: admin data from SWRS is re-imported for every filing
  Scenario: emission data from SWRS is re-imported for every filing
  Scenario: fuel data from SWRS is re-imported for every filing
  Scenario: electricity and heat data are not imported from SWRS
  Scenario: production data are not imported from SWRS
