Feature: CIIP Filing

  As an industry reporter
  I want to file a successful CIIP application
  So that I receive a CleanBC Industrial Incentive Program (CIIP) cheque

  Scenario: know when the CIIP application window will open
  Scenario: start a CIIP application for a facility that hasn't filed yet
  Scenario: automatically lock a CIIP application so others can't update it while I am updating it
  Scenario: resume a CIIP application for a facility that has a filing in progress
  Scenario: confirm all data reported in my CIIP application
  Scenario: request certification of data reported in CIIP application
  Scenario: correct fields an incentive analyst has flagged for review
  Scenario: receive confirmation that my CIIP application has been filed
  Scenario: list of all filed CIIP applications with application status
  Scenario: review an entire filed CIIP application
