<a id="facilities"></a>

### Facilities page, _aka._ "My Applications": `/reporter/facilities`

View facilities for operators to which the user has access and on behalf of which they can apply for CIIP. The listings provide links to the following actions for each facility:

  - a) start an application
  - b) resume an in-progress application
  - c) view a submitted application

**Note:** When navigating to this page via "My Applications", all applications from all the user's facilities and operators are listed. Otherwise when navigating here by clicking on an individual operator, this page shows just the applications for the facilities belonging to that operator.

#### Shared components:
- `SearchTable`

<a id="new-application-disclaimer"></a>

### New Application Disclaimer page: `/reporter/new-application-disclaimer`\*

Interstitial page that collects the reporter's consent before allowing a new application to be started.

\* Required query parameters:
- `applicationId`
- `version`

<a id="application"></a>

### Application page: `/reporter/application`\*

A set of forms, displayed in sequential tabs, allowing reporters to apply for CIIP for a specified facility.

The form tab (ie: Emissions, etc.) initially displayed on loading this page is controlled by the value of the `formResultId` query parameter. Further, the page can be loaded to display the Summary tab by appending the parameter: `confirmationPage=true` _instead_ of `formResultId`.

Form validation helps ensure the integrity of data entered before submission; however, this can be overridden by the reporter with a message justifying their reasons for not being able to fix the validation errors.

The current state of the application can be downloaded as PDF from the Summary tab.

\* Required query parameters:
- `applicationId`
- `version`
- `formResultId` (except when `confirmationPage` is present)
- \[optional parameter for showing Summary tab\]: `confirmationPage=true`

- `id` (refers to the corresponding `application_revision`)

#### Shared components:
- `RegistrationLoginButtons`
  * `LoginButton`

<a id="login-redirect"></a>

### Login Redirect page `/login-redirect`\*

\* Query parameters are not actually required here to prevent an error, but this page is intended to be used in conjunction with a `redirectTo` parameter indicating the URL to redirect to after login.

### 403 page (temporary; handles redirection after registration bug) `/403`

Temporary page to handle a specific issue with newly registered users sometimes not being automatically logged in after registration. This directs the user to click "Login" at the top of the page to complete their journey.

<a id="error-boundary"></a>

### Unknown Error page, _aka._ ErrorBoundary `(any URL)`

Displays an error message directing users to report the error on the [fider feedback site](https://ciip-feedback.pathfinder.gov.bc.ca/). Some error details are provided, which the user can copy into their bug report.

Unlike the other error pages which handle HTTP error status codes (network-level errors), this handles errors that may have originated on either client or server. It's not truly a page, but rather a component that may be displayed on any other page when an error that breaks the client-side code is triggered.

Note: An exception is that client-side errors on outdated browsers unsupported by React and Next will not trigger display of this view; those users will see a blank page instead.

### Static Text Pages nested within `/resources` folder:

####  BCGov-wide Website Disclaimer `/resources/disclaimer`

Boilerplate website disclaimer obtained from DevHub.

<a id="privacy"></a>

_______

<a id="query-parameters"></a>

## Note on required query parameters:
Asterisk\* denotes routes with required query parameters. Without certain parameters appended to the URL (providing some necessary data for the view) as key-value pairs, an error page will be shown. The expected parameters differ between pages, and multiple query parameters are separated by an `&` character. An example is the application page, which requires the following string to be appended to the end of the URL `/reporter/application`:

`?applicationId=someID&version=1&formResultId=anotherID`

In the next iteration of CIIP we aim for better compliance with REST conventions by replacing required query parameters with dynamic routes that employ route parameters instead, thus triggering a 404 when missing (as opposed to the current 500 error page).
